# project-portfolio
My project portfolio to be seen by future employers

## Description

- I wanted to build a portfolio of my work that reflected me.
- Some of the best programmers out there have their own programming portfolio so I made a step in the right direction.
- It gives my potential employers an easy way to access eveything im working on in a clear and concise manner.
- I learn a lot about formatting pages using CSS.
